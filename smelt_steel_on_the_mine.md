Smelt steel on the mine
=======================

Hi friends, welcome to [factorio-realms.com][homepage].

Several days ago, I wrote an [article][prev-article] show how to smelt ore on the mine.
After that I was so curious: Is it possible smelt steel on the mine?

I discussed with my friend senolyusan.

At first, we almost given up. Because drill only have 25 tiles area.
And we need at least: 1 drill + 2 funnaces + 4 inserters + 1 hole =
9 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 22 tiles. And there only 3 tiles for belts.

:P, but we are so boring. After many and many tries, we got it:
