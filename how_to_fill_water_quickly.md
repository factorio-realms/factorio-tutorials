How to fill water quickly?
==========================

Hi friends, welcome to [factorio-realms.com][1].

Do you like to make solar farms? Do you hate water thwarting you?
Today I will show you how to fill water quickly without mods.

The secret is `Numpad +`.

Ya, in a secret version, factorio updated and added this feature.
And without any release note. (Or maybe I just miss it, :p)

Pick up landfill, and then press `Numpad +` and `Numpad +` and `Numpad +`...

Now, it's like this~

:p, Also click 'Numpad -' to reduce fill area.

You are using a laptop or this is no Numpad on your keyboard?
Don't be worry. You can find keybinds here:
Menu => Options => Controls => Game => Larger terrain building area

Just change it. :p

That's all.
