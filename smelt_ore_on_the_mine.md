Smelt ore on the mine
=====================

Hi friends, welcome to [factorio-realms.com][1].

Still hesitating to build a smelting center or smelt near the mine?
Ya, now you have a new option. :p Why not smelt it on the mine?

Why?
----

It's really convenient. By this way, you only need one blueprint.

Pros.
-----

* Convenient: Only need one blueprint, and get plates directly.
* Good for Easily Stage: All equipment can by found in early stage.
* Smooth Upgrade: Can use stone furnace first, then upgrade to steel furnace.
* Petty Layout: There's no pretty layout for steel furnace.

Cons.
-----

* Low Efficiency: Only 45% coverage of drill (compare to 85% in radical layout)
* Cannot Use Modules: Steel furnace do not support modules.
* Cannot Use Bacon: There's no space for bacon.
* Need fuel: I don't like fuel....

Layout
------

Here's the layout for a single unit:

Blueprint
