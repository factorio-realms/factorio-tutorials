Smelt ore on the mine
=====================

Hi friends, welcome to [factorio-realms.com][1].

Still hesitating to build a smelting center or smelt near the mine?
Now we present you a new option: smelting on the mine itself!

Why?
----

It is convenient and time efficient. One blueprint is all you need to mass produce this setup.

Pros.
-----

* Convenient: You only need 1 blueprint for setup and can obtain plates directly.
* Good for Early Stage: All equipments are available in early stage.
* Smooth Upgrade: You can use stone furnace at the start and later on replace it with steel furnace.
* Tidy layout: You don't get a tidy layout of furnaces everyday.

Cons.
-----

* Low Efficiency: Only 45% coverage of drill (comparing to 85% in radical layout)
* Cannot Use Modules: Steel furnace do not support modules.
* Cannot Use Bacon: There's no space for bacon.
* Need fuel: Extra belts, inserters and mines to provide for fuel usage.

Layout
------

Here's the layout for a single unit:
